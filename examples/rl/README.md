# Reinforcement Learning (RL) Examples

This folder contains scenarios that employ reinforcement learning. It is possible to apply a common workflow to different scenarios, thanks to the abstractions from MARO's RL toolkit. The workflow can be found under ``templates``, which contains Python scripts for running the necessary components in single-threaded, synchronous and asynchronous modes. The scenario can be set 

To run single-threaded mode,
